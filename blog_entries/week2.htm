<h3>Week 2 experiments</h3>
<p>CSS3 Grid layout and responsive webpages</p>
<ul>
    <li>Grid layout with CSS helps in designing a neat layout for web apps. Generally we use a 960px span of screen in order to get 12 cells which in turn become building blocks for websites.</li>
    <li>The Responsiveness in modern websites is achieved using CSS3 media screen feature, extensively reffered to as liquid CSS.</li>
    <li>The parallax effect using simple JQuery feature.</li>

</ul>
<p>
    The Grid layout is demonstrated using a simple online book reader webapp which encompasses various features in a neat and simple web design. Each section is a well structured compartment generated using suitable colum-width cells.
</p>
<p>
    The Responsive website is pure CSS that uses media query feature to generate different layouts for different screen sizes.
</p>
<p>
    Parallaxing the Background at different speed smoothens the transition and acts like a native feature over web.
