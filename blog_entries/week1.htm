<h3>Week 1 experiments</h3>
<p>Learning HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3 features and experimenting them</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML5 has various features that ease the process of developing HTML websites like Audio and Video playback support and various new input types and tags for specific purposes.</li>
    <li>CSS3 is a powerful tool to make extremely responsive websites with new features that can work without JavaScripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I invested good amount of time taking tutorials on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> and experimenting them to gain thorough understanding. CSS3 can now perform certain things which were only possible using JavaScripts before.
    These features made web experience more lively and innovative.
