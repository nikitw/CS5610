<h3>Week 3 experiments</h3>
<p>Getting familiar with Bootstrap and JQuery</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bootstrap is integrated in all the experiments where navigation is needed</li>
    <li>Parallax effect and auto scrolling navigation implemented using JQuery</li>
    <li>Grids Tables and Drag n Drop experiments performed using JQuery</li>

</ul>
<p>
    Bootstrap is used for navigation and a clean layout. The naviagtion is made functional in all the experiments except the first one.
</p>
<p>
    Parallax is reimplemented using Debounce JQuery and also added some smooth scrolling features for navigation using JQuery.
</p>
<p>
    Grids and tables from BS play a major role in data representation, an experiement is performed using JSON data file. The Drag and Drop experiment uses a lot of JQuery fine tuned for this purpose.
