<h3>Week 4 experiments</h3>
<p>Getting familiar with AJAX, WebAPI and AngularJS</p>
<ul>
    <li>Weather API provided by OpenWeatherMap api</li>
    <li>AJAX calls using JQuery get calls populate data in Weather Widgets</li>
    <li>AngularJS basic attributes and controller</li>

</ul>
<p>
    I have use OpenWeatherMap's weather api that provides free weather data based on City name and geographical coordinates. The App is self sufficient to demonstrate a lot of features in itself and thus took a good amount of time investment to develop.
</p>
<p>
    I have done AJAX get experiments in Weather APP, and JQuery handles the creation and deletion on widgets from the app page. I had to also handle erroneous data recieved from API.

    The AngularJS experiments gives the basic usage of it's attributes and variables.
