<h3>Week 4 experiments</h3>
<p>Working with angularJS feature routing and multiple users</p>
<ul>
	<li>Building up the application from simple routing experiment</li>
	<li>Adding multiple pages and multiple controllers</li>
	<li>Adding different funtionality for different pages over same JS Object</li>
	<li>Experiment with users and roles over multiple login account and management</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I have experimented with login roles and manipulating the JS object on the fly which also reflects on page in real time
</p>
<p>
    An experiment where every login entity has its own list of items and manageable only by its own login
</p>
<p>
    Multiple pages with multiple controlles are kept in different files to ease the development and make it manageable.
