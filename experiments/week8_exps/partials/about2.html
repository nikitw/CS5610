    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        This experiment demonstrates the mongobd fetch from the server. The list of artists is grabbed using a JSONP REST
        API call to the node-mongo server and represented using an ng-repeat directive. The application is now capable of
        adding new Artists to the list and that is achieved using JSON POST REST call to the node-mongo server. The artist
        object is represented in the same schema as it is on the MongoSchema to avoid data ambiguity and manipulations.
    </p>
    <h1>Client JS Code</h1>
    <p>
        below is the code used at client to get the data from node-mongo server. The request body contains the client side
        Artist object which will be tries converting to ArtistSchema on server. If this action is successful, the artist
        is saved and returned in the response.data else and error message is reported as response.err.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
var Artist = function() {
    this.name = null;
    this.dob = null;
    this.albums = [{name:null, dor:null, songs:[{name: null, soundCloud:null}]}];
    this.genre = [{type: null}];
};

$scope.artist = new Artist();
$scope.addArtist = function () {
    lfmAPIservice.addArtist(new Request($scope.artist, function(data) {
        $scope.artists.push(data);
    }, function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }));
}

lfmAPI.addArtist = function(request) {
    $http.post(URL+"artists", request.body)
        .success(function(data) {
            ...
            request.success(data.data);
        }
    });
};
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h1>Server JS Code</h1>
    <p>
        below is the code that adds the new Artist to mongodb and gets the newly created Artist to respond to the client
         If there is no artist body provided by the REST call, the error is sent back to the client in response.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>

var Artist = db.model('artists', artistSchema);

app.post('/artists', function(req, res) {
    if(!req.body) {
        res.jsonp({err: new Error('no artist object found')});
        return;
    }
    var artist = new Artist(req.body);
    artist.save(function(err, doc) {
        if(err || !doc)
            res.jsonp({err: new Error('no artist added!')});
        else
            res.jsonp({data: doc});
    });
});
        </code>
