    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        This experiment demonstrates the mongobd fetch from the server. The list of artists is grabbed using a JSONP REST
        API call to the node-mongo server and represented using an ng-repeat directive. The application is now capable of
        Adding, Deleting and Editing Artists them. It also enables the deletion of Documents and their internal subDocuments
        & subSubDocuments individually. Now this allows adding more Albums, songs and genres.
    </p>
    <h1>Client JS Code</h1>
    <p>
        below is the code used at client to get the data from node-mongo server. Editing is fairly simple as Angular allows
        a window which reduces the code to replace the object that the add form is binded to with the to-be edited object. This rebinding
        loads the Artist in the form but takes care that UI element is only updated once the change submission was successful else
        do not change anything at all. Since the insertion and deletion was required to be only preformed on the scope variable
        that was binding to the form, the solution became quite simple. The structure of application proves its simplicity.

    <h1>Server JS Code</h1>
    <p>
        The following is the put REST API that listens to the update requests and responds with the updated Artist if
        successful. All the additions and deletions will be automatically taken care of by this piece of code since the
        update object will bear all the details needed for performing updates.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>

var Artist = db.model('artists', artistSchema);
...
app.put('/artists/:id', function(req, res) {
    ...
    Artist.findOneAndUpdate({_id: req.params.id}, req.body,function(err, doc) {
        ...
        res.jsonp({data: doc});
    });
});
...
        </code>
