    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        This experiment demonstrates the mongobd fetch from the server. The list of artists is grabbed using a JSONP REST
        API call to the node-mongo server and represented using an ng-repeat directive. The application is now capable of
        Adding, Deleting and Editing Artists them. It also enables the deletion of Documents and their internal subDocuments
        & subSubDocuments individually. But it can only add and Edit the whole document content that already exists. The modifications
        are saved on the server schema.
    </p>
    <h1>Client JS Code</h1>
    <p>
        below is the code used at client to get the data from node-mongo server. Editing is fairly simple as Angular allows
        a window which reduces the code to replace the object that the add form is binded to with the to-be edited object. This rebinding
        loads the Artist in the form but takes care that UI element is only updated once the change submission was successful else
        do not change anything at all.
    </p>

        <code>
var Artist = function() {
    this.name = null;
    this.dob = null;
    this.albums = [{name:null, dor:null, songs:[{name: null, soundCloud:null}]}];
    this.genre = [{type: null}];
};

$scope.artist = new Artist();
$scope.editIndex = null;
$scope.editArtist = function (artist, index) {
    $scope.editIndex = index;

    $scope.editIndex = null;

        $scope.artists[$scope.editIndex] = data;
        $scope.artist = new Artist();

    $http.put(URL+"artists/"+request.body._id, request.body)

    <h1>Server JS Code</h1>
    <p>
        The following is the put REST API that listens to the update requests and responds with the updated Artist if
        successful.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>

var Artist = db.model('artists', artistSchema);
...
app.put('/artists/:id', function(req, res) {
    ...
    Artist.findOneAndUpdate({_id: req.params.id}, req.body,function(err, doc) {
        ...
        res.jsonp({data: doc});
    });
});
...
        </code>
    </pre>
