        Google's Map API allows to diplay the map and location on the browser with less effort. This experiments demonstrates the
        placing multiple markers in order searched by user and also draws a polygon between them in the search order. This has an
        application in displaying planned trips as a map view.

    <h1>Client JS Code</h1>
    <p>
        The API call places all the markers in memory on the map and also draws a polygon around them.

    <pre>
        <code>
            mapsAPI.plotMarkers = function (map) {
            for(var m in markers) {
            markers[m].setMap(map);
            var n = parseInt(m)+1;
            if(n == markers.length)
            n = 0;

            new google.maps.Polyline({
            path: [markers[m].position, markers[n].position],
            strokeColor:"#99f",
            strokeOpacity:0.8,
            strokeWeight:2,
            map: map
            });
